#### Short Description:
This library works with Arduino and Particle (Photon, Electron, and Core) microcontroller boards and it provides many functions to communicate with 7 Segment LED display modules that use the AMS AS1115 chip. This chip uses the I2C communication protocol.

The library will work with 7 Segment displays up to 8 digits wide. The displays must use the AMS AS1115 LED controller chip.

A demo program (in the examples folder) demonstrates all of the functions in the I2cCharDisplay library.
